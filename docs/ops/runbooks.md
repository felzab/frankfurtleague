# Ops — runbooks

**Verified against:** `77078f34`, 2026-08-20\
**Purpose:** the recurring procedures that are run rather than read, and the operational facts no file in this repository states

The contracts these depend on — the services, the scripts, the gate scopes and the registry — are
[`spec.md`](spec.md); the pipeline a change travels from a branch to a deploy is
[`../_git/spec.md`](../_git/spec.md) §1.1. Each script's `--help` prints its header, which carries its usage.

---

## 1. The server

**The repository does not record which host this is**, and deliberately holds no credentials. Getting onto
the machine is outside the repository. What it does tell you:

- `deploy.sh` refuses to run anywhere but Linux, and runs from a **checkout of this repository on the
  server** — so putting a merge live is `git pull && ./scripts/deploy.sh`, the pull being what brings the
  compose file and `nginx/prod.conf` up to date before the containers are recreated.
- `./certs/` and `./nginx/prod.conf` must exist beside the compose file.
- After the health wait, `deploy.sh` **confirms the security headers as they are actually served** — the one
  check that reads the running stack rather than a config file.

## 2. Before deploying a change to the database's constraints

```bash
cd fl_backend && .venv/Scripts/python -m app.core.constraints --check
```

Dev, on Windows; on the server it is `python -m app.core.constraints --check` inside the backend container.
It writes nothing and exit 0 means clean. Run it whenever `fl_backend/app/core/constraints.py` changes —
what it reports, and what a database user without `collMod` produces, are
[`../backend/spec.md`](../backend/spec.md) §4. `--apply` does the same work startup does, which is how to
put a corrected constraint in place without waiting for a deploy.

**A change that only adds a read index has nothing for `--check` to answer**, and a clean report is not
evidence it landed: those indexes constrain nothing, so no stored document can be in breach of one
(`fl_backend/app/core/constraints.py :: SupportIndex`). `--apply` or the next boot is what builds it, and
either fails loudly if it cannot.

## 3. After changing anything about the brand mark

```bash
cd fl_frontend && pnpm brand
```

Regenerates the favicon, app icons, both manifest sets, the Open Graph card and the `FLLogo` component from
one parameterised source. **Re-run it rather than editing any of its outputs**, or the header mark and the
icons drift apart.

## 4. Granting or revoking admin access

Editing `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS` and restarting is the whole procedure; why a restart is needed and how `role`
is re-derived afterwards are [`spec.md`](spec.md) §4. Two things follow that are easy to get wrong:

- **The session row is not the grant.** It stays in the `authjs` database after a revocation and authorizes
  nothing, so deleting it by hand is tidying rather than revocation.
- **An admin ending their own session needs no restart at all**: the sidemenu's options menu carries a
  sign-out, which arms on the first press and ends the session on the second.
